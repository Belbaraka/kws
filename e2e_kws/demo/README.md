**Hands-on demo of the end-2-end continuous speech keywords spotting module**

![kws_diagram](demo_img.png)

You can directly record yourself and run the keyword spotting module to extract the keywords from your speech signal, or upload your own *.wav* file (*mono*, sampled at *16kHz*). <br>

***Get started*** : run the notebook __`demo.ipynb`__ to spot the keywords *another*, *percent*, *problem* and *technology* in the speech signal ***example.wav***
